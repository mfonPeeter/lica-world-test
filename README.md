## Getting Started

### Installing Packages

To install the necessary Node.js modules, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Adding Environment Variables

This project utilizes [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) to handle authentication with LinkedIn. If you intend to clone the project, you'll need to get your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` on the platform and add it to your `.env.local`.

#### Add environment variables in a file named `.env.local` at the root of your directory:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=${CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=${SECRET_KEY}
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## The Process

1. On the first day, I dedicated time to understanding the project, delving into Clerk documentation, and familiarizing myself with the Createful website. Following this, I focused on building the UI and successfully authenticated with LinkedIn using Clerk.

2. On the second day, I devoted most of my time to attempting to send a request to the LinkedIn Share API. Sadly, I encountered various error messages and was unable to proceed. With limited time remaining, I shifted my focus to enhancing the UI to make it more visually appealing. I hope that the UI compensates for my inability to integrate the LinkedIn Share API within the given timeframe

3. Since I couldn't utilize the LinkedIn Share API to create a post, I opted to deactivate all buttons on the dashboard page except for the media upload button. Additionally, users can still add images to the text area element, but they won't be able to post content with the image attached.
4. On the other pages, I included some content to indicate to users that they are still a work in progress.

Apart from the inability to make LinkedIn posts and the disabled buttons (except for the media upload button), feel free to explore the UI. Everything works perfectly and is responsive.

## Additional Details

In light of the challenges faced while attempting to utilize the LinkedIn Share API, I've provided a brief overview of some of the encountered errors.

- After successfully authenticating to LinkedIn using Clerk, I attempted to use the token generated by Clerk in the Authorization headers when making a request to the LinkedIn Share API. However, I received a message stating "invalid token." This led me to the realization that I wouldn't be able to use the token directly and needed to obtain an access token from the LinkedIn API.

- After creating an app on LinkedIn Developer's website, I added the "Share on LinkedIn" and "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" products to my app. Following this, I attempted to configure the LinkedIn connection for my production instance by following the Clerk documentation. This was done in order to see if I could obtain the access token created in my app, which would then be used to make a request to the LinkedIn Share API.

- After configuring my LinkedIn connection for my production instance, I attempted to make a POST request using Postman to the LinkedIn Share API, utilizing the access token in the Authorization headers. However, this resulted in a different error message, indicating that I needed to pass in the authenticated member ID.

- It was a different error message from "invalid token." The question now was how to access the authenticated member ID. I attempted to use the userId returned by Clerk, but it didn't work. After some research, I discovered the Profile API on LinkedIn and tried making a request to the endpoint. However, I encountered an error message indicating that I didn't have permission to make the API call. I suspect this is related to a message I found on the Profile API page:
  **The use of this API is restricted to those developers approved by LinkedIn and subject to applicable data restrictions in their agreements.**

- As I couldn't retrieve the ID of the authenticated user, I hit a roadblock in making a request to the LinkedIn Share API. After spending nearly a full day on this task and with time running out, I realized I needed to shift my focus. Given more time, I believe I could have resolved the issue. Since this was my first time working with the LinkedIn API, I encountered unexpected challenges. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to fully utilize it as required for this project. At that point, I made the decision to shift my focus to improving the UI.

**I hope this summary adequately reflects the effort I invested in learning how to post to LinkedIn using the LinkedIn Share API. It outlines the steps I took in attempting to achieve this goal, but unfortunately, none of them were successful. It's possible that there were areas where I could have improved, but if I was given more time, I am confident that I would have been able to solve the challenges I encountered.**
